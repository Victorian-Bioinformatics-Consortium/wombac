TODO
----
* timing information
* report how many samples were skipped and list them
* add .depth files
* put into folders instead of all in one dir

Version 2.0
-----------
* Major restructure
  - joint SNP calling with freebayes (parallel)
  - proper samtools filter and bwa flags
* Critical bug fixes
  - incorrect assumption about freebayes mindepth/minfrac
  - false core SNPs when including reference
* New features
  - non-core SNPs too
  - run FastTree at end
  - NEXUS output
  - CSV table output

Version 1.3
-----------
* Switched to freebayes for SNP calling
* New vcf_filter that copes with bcftools and freebayes
* Add 'snps.txt' count summary
* Add GZ.TBI outout
* Add snps.bed and snps.gff
* Change wombac-nway to use --output prefix rather than stdout

Version 1.2
-----------
* Added --distant option to help get SNPs (more sensitive alignment)
* Added --noref to exclude reference from tree (prev. was default excluded)
* Put version in --help output

Version 1.1
-----------
* Added support for *.contig.tar.gz files from Bacteria_DRAFT
* Bugfix: too many SNPs filtered out - fixed homozygous PL caller
* Bugfix: nway was totally wrong, need to use depth at each pos too
* Bugfix: Replaced faulty wombac-vcf_nway with wombac-nway

Version 1.0
-----------
* Initial release
